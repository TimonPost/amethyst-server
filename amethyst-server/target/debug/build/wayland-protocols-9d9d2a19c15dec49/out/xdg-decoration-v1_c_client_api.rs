    //! window decoration manager
    //!
    //! This interface allows a compositor to announce support for server-side
    //! decorations.
    //! 
    //! A window decoration is a set of window controls as deemed appropriate by
    //! the party managing them, such as user interface components used to move,
    //! resize and change a window's state.
    //! 
    //! A client can use this protocol to request being decorated by a supporting
    //! compositor.
    //! 
    //! If compositor and client do not negotiate the use of a server-side
    //! decoration using this protocol, clients continue to self-decorate as they
    //! see fit.
    //! 
    //! Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    //! backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
    //! may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
    //! Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
    //! the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
    //! Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
    //! version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
    //! interface version number is reset.
