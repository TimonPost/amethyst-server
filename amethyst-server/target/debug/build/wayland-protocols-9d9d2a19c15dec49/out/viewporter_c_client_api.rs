    //! crop and scale interface to a wl_surface
    //!
    //! An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which allows the
    //! client to specify the cropping and scaling of the surface
    //! contents.
    //! 
    //! This interface works with two concepts: the source rectangle (src_x,
    //! src_y, src_width, src_height), and the destination size (dst_width,
    //! dst_height). The contents of the source rectangle are scaled to the
    //! destination size, and content outside the source rectangle is ignored.
    //! This state is double-buffered, and is applied on the next
    //! wl_surface.commit.
    //! 
    //! The two parts of crop and scale state are independent: the source
    //! rectangle, and the destination size. Initially both are unset, that
    //! is, no scaling is applied. The whole of the current wl_buffer is
    //! used as the source, and the surface size is as defined in
    //! wl_surface.attach.
    //! 
    //! If the destination size is set, it causes the surface size to become
    //! dst_width, dst_height. The source (rectangle) is scaled to exactly
    //! this size. This overrides whatever the attached wl_buffer size is,
    //! unless the wl_buffer is NULL. If the wl_buffer is NULL, the surface
    //! has no content and therefore no size. Otherwise, the size is always
    //! at least 1x1 in surface local coordinates.
    //! 
    //! If the source rectangle is set, it defines what area of the wl_buffer is
    //! taken as the source. If the source rectangle is set and the destination
    //! size is not set, then src_width and src_height must be integers, and the
    //! surface size becomes the source rectangle size. This results in cropping
    //! without scaling. If src_width or src_height are not integers and
    //! destination size is not set, the bad_size protocol error is raised when
    //! the surface state is applied.
    //! 
    //! The coordinate transformations from buffer pixel coordinates up to
    //! the surface-local coordinates happen in the following order:
    //! 1. buffer_transform (wl_surface.set_buffer_transform)
    //! 2. buffer_scale (wl_surface.set_buffer_scale)
    //! 3. crop and scale (wp_viewport.set*)
    //! This means, that the source rectangle coordinates of crop and scale
    //! are given in the coordinates after the buffer transform and scale,
    //! i.e. in the coordinates that would be the surface-local coordinates
    //! if the crop and scale was not applied.
    //! 
    //! If src_x or src_y are negative, the bad_value protocol error is raised.
    //! Otherwise, if the source rectangle is partially or completely outside of
    //! the non-NULL wl_buffer, then the out_of_buffer protocol error is raised
    //! when the surface state is applied. A NULL wl_buffer does not raise the
    //! out_of_buffer error.
    //! 
    //! The x, y arguments of wl_surface.attach are applied as normal to
    //! the surface. They indicate how many pixels to remove from the
    //! surface size from the left and the top. In other words, they are
    //! still in the surface-local coordinate system, just like dst_width
    //! and dst_height are.
    //! 
    //! If the wl_surface associated with the wp_viewport is destroyed,
    //! all wp_viewport requests except 'destroy' raise the protocol error
    //! no_surface.
    //! 
    //! If the wp_viewport object is destroyed, the crop and scale
    //! state is removed from the wl_surface. The change will be applied
    //! on the next wl_surface.commit.
