    //! A keyboard shortcuts inhibitor instructs the compositor to ignore
    //! its own keyboard shortcuts when the associated surface has keyboard
    //! focus. As a result, when the surface has keyboard focus on the given
    //! seat, it will receive all key events originating from the specified
    //! seat, even those which would normally be caught by the compositor for
    //! its own shortcuts.
    //! 
    //! The Wayland compositor is however under no obligation to disable
    //! all of its shortcuts, and may keep some special key combo for its own
    //! use, including but not limited to one allowing the user to forcibly
    //! restore normal keyboard events routing in the case of an unwilling
    //! client. The compositor may also use the same key combo to reactivate
    //! an existing shortcut inhibitor that was previously deactivated on
    //! user request.
    //! 
    //! When the compositor restores its own keyboard shortcuts, an
    //! "inactive" event is emitted to notify the client that the keyboard
    //! shortcuts inhibitor is not effectively active for the surface and
    //! seat any more, and the client should not expect to receive all
    //! keyboard events.
    //! 
    //! When the keyboard shortcuts inhibitor is inactive, the client has
    //! no way to forcibly reactivate the keyboard shortcuts inhibitor.
    //! 
    //! The user can chose to re-enable a previously deactivated keyboard
    //! shortcuts inhibitor using any mechanism the compositor may offer,
    //! in which case the compositor will send an "active" event to notify
    //! the client.
    //! 
    //! If the surface is destroyed, unmapped, or loses the seat's keyboard
    //! focus, the keyboard shortcuts inhibitor becomes irrelevant and the
    //! compositor will restore its own keyboard shortcuts but no "inactive"
    //! event is emitted in this case.
