    //! blanking, locking, and screensaving.  The client binds the idle manager
    //! globally, then creates idle-inhibitor objects for each surface.
    //! 
    //! Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    //! backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
    //! may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
    //! Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
    //! the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
    //! Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
    //! version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
    //! interface version number is reset.
